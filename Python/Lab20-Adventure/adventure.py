#   MODIFICATIONS
# use more succinct commands (l/u/d/r for up/down/left/right or n/s/e/w for north/south/east/west)
#use different unicode characters (you can find lists online)
#add boundaries to the map, when the player attempts to move beyond the boundary, stop them or move them to the other side
#add an inventory system
